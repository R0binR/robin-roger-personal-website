                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                      Hi there! My name is [Your Name], and I was born on May
                      31, 2004, in Annecy, France. I'm a passionate computer
                      science engineering student currently enrolled at EPITA
                      Lyon, where I am in my first year of the engineering
                      curriculum. My journey into the world of technology began
                      in middle school, where I discovered my love for creating
                      video games. Since then, my fascination with the infinite
                      possibilities of creation in the tech world has only
                      grown. What inspires me the most about computer science is
                      the collaborative spirit of the open-source community and
                      the endless potential for innovation. These values fuel my
                      motivation to constantly learn, create, and contribute.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                      I chose EPITA Lyon for its strong reputation in training
                      top-tier engineers and the professional opportunities it
                      opens up after graduation. Beyond technical excellence,
                      what draws me to the field of engineering is its human
                      aspect—the chance to solve meaningful problems and make a
                      real impact.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Skills and Projects</h3>
                    <p>
                      Over the years, I’ve gained proficiency in a variety of
                      programming languages, including
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Python</li>
                      <li>JavaScript</li>
                      <li>C++</li>
                      <li>C</li>
                      <li>C#</li>
                      <li>OCaml</li>
                      <li>SQL</li>
                      <li>Shell</li>
                      <li>Java</li>
                      <li>Html/Css</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      One of my favorite projects was during my third year of
                      middle school when I developed a video game to help my
                      classmates review for exams. It was an exciting and
                      rewarding way to combine education with entertainment.
                      More recently, I’ve embarked on a project to design a 3D
                      web experience, showcasing my growing interest in creative
                      and immersive technologies.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                      Outside of coding, I have a passion for skateboarding and
                      traveling, which allow me to unwind and find inspiration
                      in new environments. I’m also committed to giving back to
                      the community, having participated in food distribution
                      activities with the LYON association. Additionally, I
                      enjoy working with 3D design tools like Blender. For a
                      recent school project, I recreated my entire campus in 3D
                      on my own, demonstrating both my technical and artistic
                      skills.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Learning and Growth</h3>
                    <p>
                      I am a self-driven learner who enjoys exploring new
                      technologies through online courses. My programming
                      journey began with Unreal Engine's Blueprint system via
                      Udemy, and I’ve since expanded my knowledge through
                      OpenClassrooms. I also value hands-on experiences and plan
                      to participate in my first hackathon, EXOLEGEND, which
                      focuses on robotics. Looking ahead, I aspire to specialize
                      in cybersecurity—a field that intrigues me for its
                      critical importance and dynamic challenges. To that end,
                      I’ve started training on platforms like TryHackMe and
                      HackTheBox to build my expertise.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Philosophy and Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                      As an aspiring engineer, my philosophy is simple: "Bring
                      simple solutions to complex problems." Inspired by the
                      words of Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web—"It's
                      not the machine that's important, but what you do with
                      it"—I am driven by the belief that technology is a tool to
                      create meaningful change.
